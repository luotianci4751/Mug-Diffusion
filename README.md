MuG Diffusion is a charting AI for rhythm games based on [Stable Diffusion](https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion/) (one of the most powerful AIGC models) with a large modification to incorporate audio waves. Given an audio file, MuG Diffusion is able to generate high-quality diverse charts, which is aligned with the music and highly controllable. Currently, it supports 4K vertical scroll rhythm game (VSRG) only, with the following control options:

- Difficulty: supporting both [osu! star rating system](https://osu.ppy.sh/wiki/en/Beatmap/Star_rating) and [Etterna MSD system](https://etternaonline.com/).
- Style: ranked beatmaps ([osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/)) / stable charts ([Malody](https://m.mugzone.net/)), or other beatmap styles. 
- LNs: the ratio of the number of long notes to the total.
- Patterns: supporting all patterns in Etterna MSD system, including chordjack, stamina, stream, jumpstream, handstream and technical.

MuG Diffusion aims to support other rhythm games in the future (osu!standard, 5-8K VSRG, maimai, etc), and hopes to provide a beneficial AIGC tool for all the charters and players.

## Installation and Running

### Bundled Executable

I packaged a bundled executable containing all the dependencies and model weights in the Windows platform, which is available at:
- [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-TmLsveLAjRCPwd0iwXS7V1v61MlQ7DM/view?usp=share_link)
- [hiosu](https://dl2.hiosu.com/d/kuit/MugDiffusion.zip)

Unzip the file and double click "Mug Diffusion.exe", which will open a browser interface for controlling. It takes around 30 seconds on my computer (NVidia 3050Ti, 4GB memory) to generate four charts for a 3-minute-long audio.


### Running from Source

If you use other platforms, other GPU types or want to run from source, here are the instructions.

- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

- Install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)

- Install other requirements:

```commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Install [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html), make sure that `ffmpeg` command can execute correctly.

- Download the bundled executable, and copy the file `models/ckpt/model.ckpt` and `models/ckpt/model.yaml` to `{REPOSITORY_ROOT}/models/ckpt/*`.

- Run the WebUI:

```commandline
python webui.py
```

## Acknowledgement

In order to ensure the fairness and transparency of training, the dataset list is published in [here](https://mugdiffusion.keytoix.vip/dataset.html). 

Thank all the Charters / Mappers in the community. It's you who endowed MuG Diffusion with intelligence. Besides, I would like to thank the [Malody](https://m.mugzone.net/) development teams (and many other supporters that cannot be listed due to space limit TAT) for the financial support.

Thank [raber](https://github.com/zengrber) for webui development, [RiceSS](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/8271436) for logo design, and many testers for their support. 

Special thanks: 
- [kangalio](https://github.com/kangalio/): for [MinaCalc-standalone](https://github.com/kangalio/minacalc-standalone), which is a component of MSD controlling system.
- [Evening](https://github.com/Eve-ning/): for [reamberPy](https://github.com/Eve-ning/reamberPy), which provides a very intuitive visualization of generated charts.
